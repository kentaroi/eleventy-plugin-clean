This is an experimental plugin for [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) to keep the output directory clean.

I know you wouldn't do this, but please don't put your valuable files directly in your `output` directory without a backup.

## Installation

```bash
npm install eleventy-plugin-clean
```

Add it to Eleventy config file (usually `.eleventy.js`)

```JavaScript
const clean = require("eleventy-plugin-clean");

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(clean);
};
```

If you are using `git`, add the following line to your `.gitignore`.
```gitignore
.plugin-clean
```

If you are not using `git`, add it to your `.eleventyignore` file instead of the `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

eleventy-plugin-clean does not delete files which were not written by Eleventy or had been created before the installation of the plugin.

Therefore, you may want to clean the `output` directory once before using it.
```bash
rm -rf _site/*
```

## What it actually does

eleventy-plugin-clean uses LMDB, a key-value store, to store all the data needed to keep the `output` directory clean. The DB is located at `.plugin-clean` in your project root.

It keeps the build number of Eleventy project.
The build number is an integer value that it automatically increases with each Eleventy build.

It uses the key-value store to store build numbers for the files in the `output` directory.
In other words, eleventy-plugin-clean knows all of the files in the `output` directory and each of the file records has its build number that generated the file.

When Eleventy (re)builds the site, it updates the build numbers for all of the output files generated by the build.

At the end of each build, it removes the files in the `output` directory which have a build number older than the current build number and deletes their records from the key-value store.

## Limitations

Suppose you are running `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`.

eleventy-plugin-clean does not detect file deletions since Eleventy doesn't listen `unlink` events but only listens `change` and `add` events:

https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/blob/1db6a10a98f35b6f6bcac94222cdd8597e6f7928/src/Eleventy.js#L953-L961

Therefore, when you remove a file from your `input` directory, nothing will happen.

However, after that, if you change or add another file or if you re-run `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` or `npx @11ty/eleventy`, it will remove the file(s) in the `output` directory which had been generated from the above removed file.
